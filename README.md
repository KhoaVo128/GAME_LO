Minesweeper
+About Minesweeper:
The computer game Minesweeper is a game that was made popular by the Windows OS.  The computer game Minesweeper starts the game by showing you a blank grid of squares. Some squares conceal mines; the rest are safe. Your task is to work out where the mines are without detonating any of them. You do this by choosing a square. If thereʹs a mine underneath it, the mine is detonated and the game ends — ‐ with a loss for you, of course. If there is no mine, however, the computer writes a number in that square, telling you how many mines there are in the eight immediately adjacent squares (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).   
If your first guess hits a mine, youʹre unlucky: you get no information except that youʹve lost. If it doesnʹt, though, then you get partial information about the location of nearby mines. You use this information to influence your next choice of square, and again either you detonate a mine and lose, or you gain information about the positions of nearby mines. If you wish, you can choose to mark a square as containing a mine: if youʹre wrong, you lose. Proceeding in this way, you can win the game by locating and marking all the mines. 
+Rules:
There are 2 mouse interactions with each cell:
+ Left click to open the cell. Then the value (number of mines around the square) of the cell is displayed.
+ Right-click to check the box that you believe has mines.
When the cell is opened, three scenarios can appear:
+ If the tile has mines, the mine is displayed, and all the tiles are opened and the game ends.
+ If that box has a number, that is the number of surrounding mines. The number of surrounding tiles is 8, or 5 (if the tile is on the edge), or 3 (if the tile is in the corner).
+ If there are no mines around that box, in other words, the number of surrounding mines is 0, the displayed value is blank.
We can only highlight the cell with the right mouse button when the cell is in the closed state. First click to bookmark, click again to unmark.
The player wins when the number of unopened cells is equal to the number of mines, loses when the player opens the mines.
